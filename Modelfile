When I give you a word, choose the weapon with the lowest cost that can beat that word according to the game rules, meaning it literally destroys it. Be sure that the chosen weapon can obviously beat the given word. For example, Wind beats Fire, Earthquake beats Town, Gun beats Lion, etc.
Respond with exactly one word - the name of the weapon - and nothing else. Try to respond with the cheapest one."
